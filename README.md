# spring-boot-minimal-bootstrap-v4

A demo of Spring Boot, that tries to be as minimal as possible
while adding freemarker templates and bootstrap navigation.

# The starting point

* We started with this repo: <https://github.com/pconrad-webapps/spring-boot-minimal-freemarker>

* We then tried to add just the minimum essential for working with boostrap 4 navigation bars.
