			<h3> Sowing</h3>
			<p>
			Sowings may be made between February and May where sufficient heat is available. Cucumber seed should be sown singly either in 7.5cm (3in) pots or spaced 2.5cm (1in) apart in boxes or pans. A temperature of 15°C (60°F) is necessary for the ordinary varieties and 21°C (70°F) for the “All Female” types. When sowing in 7.5cm pots, some people prefer to no more than half fill the pot at sowing time, subsequently adding more compost at a later stage and avoiding the disturbance of re-potting and yet encouraging necessary vegetative growth.
			</p>
			<h3>Pricking-off</h3>
			<p>
			If sown in boxes or pans, the seedlings should be pricked off into 7.5cm (3″) pots after seven or eight days and must be planted fairly deeply with the seed leaves almost touching the soil surface, or the plants will become leggy. Do not completely fill the pot with compost, to allow topping-up with suitable compost as the stem elongates.
			</p>
			<h3>Planting-out</h3>
			<p>
			About three weeks after sowing, the plants can be planted out 2 per growing bag or individually into a 25cm (10in) pots. After planting out, a day temperature of between 15°C (60°F) and 21°C (70°F) should be maintained and the night temperature should not be allowed to fall below 15°C (60°F).
			</p>
			<h3>Growing-on</h3>
			<p>
			Cucumber plants should be trained up towards the roof with laterals tied to horizontal wires or strings. The tips of the laterals are usually pinched out after two leaves from the main stem, provided both axils of the leaves are showing fruit buds. All male flowers should be removed and also any fruits which are being produced on the main stem itself. It is most important to ensure that the plant receives no ‘check’ (e.g. temperature drop, incorrect watering, lack of nutrients, etc.) as its development may be affected.
			</p>
			<h3>Cropping</h3>
			<p>
			Over-cropping must be avoided and it is sometimes necessary to thin out the fruits in the early stages. Periodical top-dressing with a compost around the base of the plant is necessary, especially if young roots are showing. A constant supply of water at the roots is essential and the atmosphere should be kept reasonably moist by overhead spraying. Stagnant conditions must not be allowed to develop. When the first fruits start to swell feed at fortnightly intervals with a tomato fertilizer.</p>
