   <h1>Personal Dashboard</h1>
  <p>This page will have information about the plants you want to grow containing information from the "Seasonal Plants" page . It will tell you
  where to plant(in shade or direct sunlight), what plants you should avoid planting with, etc.
After the initial info about all the plants you plan to grow, there will be a journal. The journal will pull details from
the weather/map page and track when you have to water the plants and other information necessary to take care of these plants (like moving plants indoors during cold weather).
