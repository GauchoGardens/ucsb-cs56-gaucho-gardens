			<h4> Sowing</h4>
			<p>
				Plant seeds ½ inch deep and 1-2 inches apart.
				Make sure soil remains moist for germination.
				In zones with low moisture and rainfall, soak the seeds for 24 hours before planting.
				Early crop can be planted in March/April, and late crop anytime from June to September. Successive plantings are also possible as long as the weather doesn’t exceed 75°F. Space plantings about 20 days apart.
				Winter crops are a definite possibility in Zone 9 and above.
			</p>
			<h4>Pricking-off</h4>
			<p>
				Thinning is necessary, as you may get more than one seedling out of each seed. Thin when they reach about 2 inches high by pinching them off. Pulling them out of the ground may disturb the roots of nearby seedlings.
				Established plants should be thinned to 3–4 inches between plants.
			</p>

			<h4>Growing-on</h4>
			<p>
				Mulch and water well. Beets need to maintain plenty of moisture.
				Any necessary cultivation should be gentle, beets have shallow roots that are easily disturbed.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Harvest</h4>
			<p>
				Days to maturity tend to be between 50 and 70 for most varieties, although they can be harvested at any time you see fit. If you like larger bulbs, wait longer, but understand they will be tougher and woody.
				Don’t let greens grow above 6 inches before harvesting.
				Don’t forget about the tops! Beet greens have a delicious and distinctive flavor, and hold more nutrition than the roots.
